Paste your webhook in like shown in the video, then go to line 89 in main.py, follow the instructions to set your gist link.

then, set a different webhook for the keylogger & camera recorder webhook (this is necessary because it floods the chat)

Next, go to line 392 and if you'd like, enable the scare settings.

We all know you cant code for shit but skidding peoples hard work, is just not it \
Profiting from it is just even more f\*cked up \
I hope you end up on the streets begging for spare change
